## Notable Projects  

### **Fitness App (C++)**  
A **command-line fitness tracking application** that allows users to log their physical activities, calculate calories burned, and determine BMI.  
- Implements **object-oriented programming** principles like **inheritance and polymorphism**.  
- Supports **step counting, BMI calculation, cycling, and swimming activity tracking**.  
- Includes a **basic authentication system** for user login and account creation.  

This project showcases my ability to build **structured, interactive applications in C++** while focusing on user experience and efficiency.  

### **Hospital Management System (Spring Boot)**
A hospital management application built with **Spring Boot** to organize and automate core healthcare operations.

- Provides RESTful APIs for patients, doctors, appointments, and medical records.
- Uses Spring Data JPA for database management.
- Includes role-based authentication with Spring Security for secure access.
- Supports appointment scheduling, patient registration, billing, and prescriptions.

This project demonstrates my ability to develop secure, maintainable backend systems using Java and Spring technologies.

### **Hospital Management System (MERN Stack)**
A hospital management system developed with the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for efficient healthcare administration.
- Features a React frontend for easy user interaction.
- Implements a Node.js and Express backend with RESTful APIs.
- Stores data in MongoDB for flexibility and scalability.
- Supports user authentication, appointment booking, dashboards, and billing.

This project showcases my skills in building full-stack web applications with modern JavaScript frameworks.
